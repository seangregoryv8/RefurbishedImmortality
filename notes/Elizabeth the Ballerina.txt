Elizabeth's an intern, and really interested in the field of sciences
She should indeed be the least hellish one of them all ofc but maybe the instict part could be 
kept bc of something from her own past since anthonys past ties in with him as a person
Like she was never instructed to stab someone if things go arry hence the building guilt
So I like what ya got going but I think there should be more reason for why her first instinct 
was to stab a child to death
Maybe since she represents a ballaerina that could tie into her past to help her lead up to doing that
Ballerinas are swift and precise, hence maybe her perfection or going above and beyond for work
They’re also heavily diciplined so maybe that could play something
Maybe she was pushed around in the past and never able to defend herself from such yet when 
this child woke up she began to see it as something else, something (or someone) that could 
hurt her and decided she wasn’t going to let that happe to her again
So she, in her past, was heavily precise and very harsh on herself for perfection
So much so that she got bullied because of it, abused, and taken advantage of
But she kept going from it because of a belief that things would eventually get better, she 
would finally have her break
And she begun to almost get drunk on the idea that this would come eventually, and nothing would get in her way
Which causes her to not take others into consideration despite them all working on the same thing
She cares for the patient but in the momment that patient woke up, she saw it as only an obstacle
