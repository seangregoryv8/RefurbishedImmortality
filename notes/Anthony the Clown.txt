Anthony started this in order to see if childrens minds could be transferred into data and live eternally
And he initially wanted to do this with dead corpses, but the brains werent found to be that activated
And they needed live test subjects
So he manipulated marketing and, from various orphanages, gathered children without parents as experiments
He, as a younger man, had a very distant father who would actively beat his mom when he got home, though Anthony looked up to him
For being a man sheerly focused on his work
No matter how much his father ignored him'
He admired his dad, even though he was sheerly focused on his own work
So he doesnt have much in terms of family
And, on top of it, hes autistic, so he has a lot more trouble socially
But he still thinks of things very robotically and methodically
And represents the face of the corporation
He literally doesnt have the capability to need that sorta connection
Despite the cheery outlook
He's an incredibly cold and calculated individual who rarely loses his cool
And when he does, he goes absolutely insane
