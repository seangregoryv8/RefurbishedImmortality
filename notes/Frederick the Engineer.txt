Now, onto Fred
Aka the most sadistic of the bunch
Hired for his skills with hardware, no one thought to do a background check on him, and he was just hired to maintain the place
He was an orphan himself, abandoned at birth
And was heavily bullied by the others
So when he heard about this opportunity, he took it
After news of Elizabeth's kill, something happened to Fred
Something snapped in him
He realized a limit was takena way
And he could now do what he always wanted
He murdered these children, disguising it as "research", where, when they were finished with these tests, he would kill them in darkness
And mysteriously return a few days later with organs needed for their research
Much to everyone else's disagreements, he carried on, essentially doing the old FNAF but with computers
What if instead he still had this sadistic mindset but instead gaslight the kids and got them to obey him in a way on the outside they would seem just perfect and obedient to the test
And over time he just got more and more cruel with the abuse to where heâ€™s down right physically abusing them and forcing them to basically give there life to him so it looks more like a suicide than the dude outright killing them even tho in a way he basically did
